# Overview
- EcoNova is a comprehensive mobile app designed to promote sustainable e-waste management and reduce its environmental impact through responsible recycling practices. By integrating gamification, our platform makes recycling both engaging and rewarding. Users participate in community-driven activities, events, and friendly competitions, earning credits for recycling e-waste, which can be exchanged for a variety of gifts. This approach encourages greater user involvement in e-waste recycling.

- The app features a scan functionality that provides detailed information about electronic components, helping users make informed recycling decisions. It also offers a dedicated marketplace for users to sell their electronics, ensuring they are reused or properly recycled. Additionally, users can schedule pickups for their e-waste, which is collected directly from their location and delivered to recycling plants. The app includes a progress dashboard, allowing users to track their contributions and see the positive environmental impact theyâ€™re making. EcoNova also fosters community engagement by offering various communities that users can join, along with an events tab to stay updated on upcoming e-waste initiatives. The app empowers users to report illegal e-waste disposal activities, such as the burning of electronics, to authorities, ensuring responsible recycling practices.
